# EXTRACTION-STRUCTURING-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-Final-Year-Project
**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** The goal of this project is to design and implement a mobile application, which will take a picture using mobile camera or capture a screenshot of any sort of tabular data in jpg or png format and then detect the table in that picture, extract its information and convert it into an editable excel sheet, where each cell can be edited and used for further analysis. 
**USE CASES:** 
• Scanning Documents to Phone: We often capture images of important tables on the phone and save them, but with the table extraction technique, we can capture the images of the tables and store them directly into excel. With this, we need not search for images or copy the table content to any new files, instead, we can directly use the imported tables and start working on the extracted information. 
• Invoice Automation: There are many small-scale and large-scale industries whose invoices are still generated in tabular formats. These do not provide properly secured tax statements. To overcome such hurdles, we can use table extraction to convert all invoices into an editable format and thereby, upgrade them to a newer version.
